Given an oriented graph, determine if it has a cycle of negative weight and print it (if exists).

Input
Input's first line has number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) — number of vertices in the graph. Each of the next N lines contains N numbers — all representing an adjacency matrix. All weights are strictly less than 10000 by absolute value. If there is no edge, corresponding value will be exactly 100000.

Output
First line should YES if there exists a negative cycle, or NO otherwise. If the cycle exists, second line should should contain the number of vertices in that cycle and third line should contain indices of those vertices (in cycle order).
